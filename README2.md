I've added the link buttons in the search and list books components with the to="" attribute pointing to either the home page or to search and that got the back button working in the browser. I can now click on the add button and the URL changes. From the search bar, I can now click on the back button and the URL will change back to the homepage URL of "/". 

What's not working is that both the search component and the list books components are showing. I want only the list books view to show and I want to switch over to the search view when the user clicks on the add book button.

- one thing i need to do is add the header and footer content to the search page, but that's pretty minor and would also be a huge pain in the neck
- another more important thing is to not show the search page on initial page load and to only show after the user clicks the add book button
